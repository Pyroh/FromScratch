# FromScratch
Easily reset permissions for your macOS apps through a GUI that calls the tccutil framework( is it a framework? I don't know what else to call it).

## FAQ
### How come I can't reset all permissions yet? Only Microphone and Screen Capture?
When I was building the app I only needed those. It's trivial to add the rest so I expect to do that soon, if nobody else beats me to it!

### Can I help contribute?
Yes, please! If you have any features you want to add, please create an issue or PR.
